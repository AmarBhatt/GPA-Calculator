Motives:
    
    I wanted to learn C, so once I took an online video lecture series on Lynda.com (http://www.lynda.com/Eclipse-tutorials/CC-Essential-Training/94343-2.html) 
    I decided I needed to test what I learned.  I often found myself in school figuring 
    out what my GPA would be if I got 'X' in a class.  I rolled with that idea and decided 
    that to test my C knowledge I would make a GPA Calculator application.
